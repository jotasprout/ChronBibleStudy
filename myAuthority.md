# My Authority

## Why I Am Not Qualified

- I didn't finish my major in Christian Studies at Hillsdale College. I only attended for one year but it was mostly classes toward that major under Doctor Michael Bauman.
- I've been married three times and committed adultery in two of them
- I have had a lot of sex outside of marriage
- I've lied
- I've stolen
- I identified as a Satanist for like three years in my teens and took it pretty seriously reading texts about Satanism, Witchcraft, etc.
- Totally abandoned/lost my faith during adulthood for a few years during adulthood
- During that dark period courted with Satanism again
- Had a LOT of bitterness and anger for a long time

## Why You Might Trust Me

- I can read a Bible all by myself
- I don't believe everything or everyone I see, hear, or read
- I've done research, write documentation, teach, and do instructional design for a living
- I want to make the Bible engaging, fun, educational, and spread the Word so this is done with love, passion, and hope
- I was a journalist for years and believe in accuracy and objectivity
- I won a medal at Howe Military School for "Senior Who Contributed the Most to the Church"
- I've been saved and attended church and Bible Studies for most of the last 40 years
- I took notes like a madman every time
- I love me some footnotes, cross-references, concordances, using multiple translations including Greek & Hebrew versions
- I own a motherload of pens and highlighters of countless colors so you can definitely tell I am a true Christian (that's meant to be a joke -- true but a joke).
